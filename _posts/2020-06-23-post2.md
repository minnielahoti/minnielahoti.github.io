# Regression Project - Predicting future prices of Bulldozers

Welcome back!

In this blog post I provide an overview of a Regression project I undertook to solidify my understanding of Supervised Regression Problems.

I used a [dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/c/bluebook-for-bulldozers/data) from kaggle.com to predict the auction prices of Bulldozers. The dataset was divided into 3 sections: train, valid, and test. I fitted multiple regression models and validated them before finally using the test set to score the best performing regression model. Want to know the best model? You're goign to have to read my notebook for that!

The details of the execution of the entire project can be found in this [notebook](https://github.com/minnielahoti/data-science-machine-learning/blob/master/Regression-project-predict-bulldozer-price/bluebook-bulldozer-price-regression.ipynb).

Similar to my [Heart Disease Classification Project](https://minnielahoti.github.io/2020/06/13/post1.html), I used a 6 step framework to solve the problem at hand.

Easy Peasy.
