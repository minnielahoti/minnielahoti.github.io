# Predicting Heart Disease using Machine Learning

In this blog I will be diving deep into my approach on how I used a supervised classification machine learning
approach to predict whether or not someone in the future will have heart disease. 

So let's get started!

My detailed work is shown in this [notebook](https://github.com/minnielahoti/data-science-machine-learning/blob/master/Classification-heart-disease/heart-disease-classification.ipynb)

# Problem Statement
> Given the dataset, can we predict whether or not someone will have heart disease. 

I followed a 6 step approach, as shown below:

First, I analyzed the data to understand the various features provided and their relationship with one another. This is called Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA).
